ignore all the log files

me: k

sixjuwel: basically

tw_mentions.py collects the metions and its stats daily
5:17 PM
tw_politic.py collects daily number of followers /followings/lists/tweets

and userinfoScript.py collects the actual ids of followers.

did you try mysql?

me: yeah you can see the db schema with mysql
5:18 PM
im guessing tw_politic

is the db where stuff is stored

sixjuwel: yeap

i figured

once you in the database

and do show tables;

oh god
5:19 PM
i'll just tell you what i know,

me: haha

sixjuwel: but there are modifications since I left

candidates table is the list of candidates, their name, twitter accountname
5:20 PM
candidatestats is the table where the tw_politic.py saves onto.

the

followers

should be the actual ids of followers

and the followings are the ids of any candidate is following.
5:21 PM
since I believe

professors asked to get the november 5th ids

use followers_nov5

me: k so look at followers_nov5

sixjuwel: I only know until this part,

me: and to get followers, for each candidate in candidates

select all followers_nov5 rows with that candidate id

does that sound right to you?

sixjuwel: yeap
5:22 PM
but makesure to check the id_str

me: yeah im a bit confused by the field names

like which are the twitter_ids, vs just some arbitrary id

sixjuwel: ok

so

twitter has two "ids" for each user

when you do
5:23 PM
select * from candidates limit 1

id_str is the actual "unique" id for a user

and screen_name is the http://twitter.com/screen_name

user can always change their screen name so we stored the id_str as well

also
5:24 PM
I am assuming professor told you about the unique "ID"

did you get the excel file?

me: nope...its been kind of bizzare, i havent really been told or received anything

sixjuwel: yea

i was like that too

the day I first got into this project

somebody else was already building this

and I was like, wtf

ok

so
5:25 PM
if you see my folder

me: haha yeah

sixjuwel: /home/namsoman/Somang

there is

account_full_oct25.xls

download that

and open if,

you'll find 8 digits at the last column

that 8 digit number is what professors made for each candidates,
5:27 PM
so that it can be decyphered as something meaningful

me: k scped the .xls, looking at it now

sixjuwel: k
5:28 PM
me: I think they described this number to me, i forget, but something about district

i could look it up in an email.. it was weird they told me about it as though it were for a hypothetical exercise

without actually telling me where i would find the real data where these numbers were stored

sixjuwel: oh
5:29 PM
i just sent the email

me: maybe im wrong, just guessing here

sixjuwel: haha

they are like that,

i've been worked for 8 months

and yea

its kind of hard thing to appetite them all

anyways

me: k awesome

sixjuwel: so

me: this is actually different than what i saw for exercise. but yeah makes sense
5:30 PM
sixjuwel: oh

well

maybe they changed it

remember i left few months ago

me: right i got u

btw really appreciate your help

sixjuwel: npnp

me: but anyway, did you parse these numbers into mysql

sixjuwel: what you should do is

get onto followers
5:31 PM
do

describe followers_nov5;

me: yup looking at table

so candidateid refers to those numbers?

sixjuwel: the candidateid is the excel file id

yeap

userid is the screen name

id_str is the twitter id
5:32 PM
followersid is the actual "follower"

me: wait sorry.. I though id_str would be twitter_id of the follower

how is followersid different

?

sixjuwel: oh

the
5:33 PM
id_str is the id of the candidate

me: kk

is followersid the twitter id of the follower?
5:34 PM
sixjuwel: yes

it might be helpful if you research on Twitter API a bit

it follows their json return,

me: kkk sweet. So that seems like pretty much everything i need. I've worked with the twitter api some before

sixjuwel: great

Ashwin the other guy,
5:35 PM
me: the only thing, is because I'm talking to you and not ashwin.. im a little concerned its changed

sixjuwel: yea

check with Ashwin

i mean

you can still write a script for doing this

me: yeah will do, but atleast now I can ask him really easily

thats also true

sixjuwel: yeap

me: except they specifically want the data form nov5

sixjuwel: yeap

me: does twitter let you retroactive?

ive never done that
5:36 PM
sixjuwel: I don't believe so,

but you can just

check our database

just select * from date = "2012-11-05" limit 100

or something liek that

we've been storing data from lastyear

like august i believe

I'm assuming they are talking about that part.
5:37 PM
me: yeah. ok last question, just thought of something

sixjuwel: are you going to write the python ?

me: so you think date filed in followers_nov5

is the date this object was saved

sixjuwel: oh

me: like when you found this follow relationship

sixjuwel: well

if it hasn't changed,
5:38 PM
I wrote the script to store the ids daily

on specific date.

so I guess the table followers_nov5

has the ids of followers on Nov 5

me: should hopefully all have date nov5 in that field

sixjuwel: double check with Ashwin though

yeap

me: will do

k thank you very much again!
5:39 PM
you make it sound like it was kindof shitty being an ra for this project.. hope it works out better for me haha
5:40 PM
sixjuwel: lol

yeap

anyways

time for me to go another meeting again

:/

gl with everything

and

let me know if you have another question

send me a email

or

leave gmsg
5:41 PM
me: gl to you as well. If I'm ever in toronto will repay the favor. peace
5:42 PM
haha that sounded weird, i meant like buy you a drink
